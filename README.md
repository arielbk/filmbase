This project was started while following along with [LevelUpTuts' React 16 For Everyone course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-16-for-everyone). It has been majorly built up since then, but the course was great at instilling some modern React techniques into my workflow including async/await, ESLint and PropTypes.
