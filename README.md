This project was started while following along with [LevelUpTuts' React 16 For Everyone course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-16-for-everyone). It has been majorly built up since then, but the course was great at instilling some modern React techniques and practices into my workflow including async/await, ESLint, setting PropTypes and default props.

## Tech stack
- React (from Create-React-App)
- React-Router
- Styled Components
- React Testing Library with Jest

## Test and deploy
